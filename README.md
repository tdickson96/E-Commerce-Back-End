# <E-commerce Back-end>

## Description

This project uses MySQL to source and seed a database for products with tag ids and categories. The relationships are built in the models and the routes are build to find, add, update, and delete products through route-checks. 

Learned to focus on the development of async functions to queue stacks. Focused on models and routes through MySQL.
